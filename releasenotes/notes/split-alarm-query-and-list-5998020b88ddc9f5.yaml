upgrade:
  - Alarm list and query has been split into two separate functions
    in the SDK layer( CLI user still uses alarm list with --query
    or --filter as before).
deprecations:
  - Calling alarm list function with query parameter has been deprecated
    and will be removed in python-aodhclient 0.7.0, please use alarm query
    function instead.
